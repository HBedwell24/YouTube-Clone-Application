# Youtube API Integration (Work in Progress)
The end goal of this project is to successfully retrieve the videos from an authenticated user's subscriptions, and display them within a VideoAdapter in an orderly fashion.

### To meet this criteria, the tasks that are left to be completed are as follows:
[ ] Merge Profile Activity with Authentication Activity to permit use of authenticated GET requests through a provided token
[ ] Revise UI/UX to more accurately reflect principles present in Material 2.0 Guidelines
[ ] Optimize main thread usage by creating more asynchronous tasks 
[ ] Clean up unused Java classes and/or models

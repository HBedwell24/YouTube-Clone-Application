# Youtube API Integration (Work in Progress)
The end goal of this project is to successfully retrieve the videos from an authenticated user's subscriptions, and display them within a VideoAdapter in an orderly fashion.

To meet this criteria, the tasks that are left to be completed are as follows:
- [x] Merge Profile Activity with Authentication Activity to permit use of authenticated GET requests through a provided token
- [x] Revise UI/UX to more accurately reflect principles present in Material 2.0 Guidelines
- [x] Optimize main thread usage through the use of asychronous tasks 
- [ ] Clean up unused Java classes and/or models

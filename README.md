# YouTube API Integration
Following the authentication of an authorized user through a YouTube.Builder client, the workflow of the application allows for an individual to view subscriptions unique to that account, as well as videos that are trending across the entire YouTube platform (with no specific category in mind). In addition, one can also browse suggested videos based on relevance to the video ID of the media of choice, which can promote an exploratory experience similar to that of the official YouTube application.
